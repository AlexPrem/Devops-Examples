# docker-devops-examples
Some devops services run inside docker
### Purpose
The ability to quickly bring up services that support your main application is very valuable. Docker allows this.
This repo has some images that I use to test, monitor and deploy applications.

Each directory contains a README.md to explain how I use each image.
